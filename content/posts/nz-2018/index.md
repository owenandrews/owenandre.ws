description: "Auckland to Queenstown in a campervan"

Last year I spent the best part of two weeks exploring the south island of New Zealand in a campervan with my mate [@brodiefarrell](https://www.instagram.com/brodiefarrell/). It was a great adventure and New Zealand's rugged but natural landscape left me keen to see more. So this year, when the opportunity came again,  time taking an extra week and starting out from Auckland on the north island with my partner [@lily\_\_ht\_\_](https://www.instagram.com/lily__ht__/). I don't

## Coromandel Peninsular
After landing in Auckland and collecting our campervan we decided to get out of suburbia as quickly as possible and head for the Coromandel Peninsular. Our first stop was at Thames, a coastal mining town. The remanants of old mine shafts dotted through the hills along with a local mining school gave it a very industrial vibe, not dissimilar to Zeehan on the west coast of Tasmania (if you can imagine Zeehan with a population of 6,500). 20 minutes north is Tapu, a shack town that made for a great spot to set up camp for our first night.

Continuing around the penisular we stopped at Coromandel, Whitianga and Hot Water Beach. Other than being a beautiful ocean beach, Hot Water Beach also has a thermal spring that seeps out of the sand. The spring genertaes about 10-15 litres of pipping hot water a minute, with temperatures up to 60ยบ.

## Whakapapa
Being a *Lord of the Rings* and *The Hobit* fan, Lily wouldn't let us drive past the set of Hobiton without *at least* having a look. Continuing south we raced through Rotorua and Taupo, heading for Mt Whakapapa in the Tongariro National Park. We stayed the night at the base of the mountain and completed a couple of short walks.

## East Coast & Wellington
Having recieved our short dose of snow we headed back to the coast at Napier on the East Coast, and made our way south to Wellington. Although relatively flat, the rolling hills of the east coast provided  Unfortunetly, due to having to board the ferry for Picton, we were only able to spend a mere 6 hours exploring Wellington. The Wellington Cable Car was a definete highlight, as was our tour of Weta Workshops. The ferry to Picton on the south island takes around 4 to make its crossing, a great oportunity to enjoy the onboard food and free WiFi!

## Kaikoura
From Picton we chose to take the east coast road toward Christchurch. For much of the route the road sticks close to the coast, with steep slopes to the right and sandy beaches and the vast Pacific Ocean to our left. We setup camp on a small point just off the highway, the only locals to contend with were the friendly seals.

## Waipara
After Kaikoura the road heads inland again on its way to Christchurch. Even though the ocean is only a few dozen kilometers away, the scenery becomes much more rural and dotted with vineyards.
